# Simple template

Most big projects use blade or twig as their templating language, but people that haven't worked that long with PHP or only worked in corporate PHP projects don't know that PHP started as a templating language!

And where you can use some static analysis with Blade and Twig (There are some tools that add some checks but don't provide full static analysis), going back to basics means that all templates are fully static analysis friendly!
